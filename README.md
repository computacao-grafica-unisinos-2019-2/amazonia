# Computação Gráfica Unisinos


If you have a CMake integrated IDE, the build and run is easy. I strongly recommend Jetbrains' [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
.



Unix-like systems store the libs and C files for include under:

* /usr/local/lib
* /usr/local/include


brew install cmake
brew install glew


# Parking Lot

This section describes features that could be implemented but due to time restrictions they were not.

* Replace cMake with xMake
